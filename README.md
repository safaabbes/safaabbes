# âœ¨ Welcome to My GitHub Realm âœ¨

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Safa, An ICT Engineering Master Student specializing in Signal Processing and Understanding. 
My passion for Signal Processing first derived from my love for music as a keyboard player and the more I learn the more I'm intrigued by this field of studies. For the past 2 years I also started my adventure with Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I was and still am highly fascinated by these studies and I hope to pursue a career that allows me to achieve projects and tasks that puts in play the knowledge I'm learning from signals to images to designing performant models.
In my repositories, you'll mostly find Deep Learning and Computer Vision Projects. Some are basic ones I did while still learning the basics and also more advanced ones. I still have a long way to go but I hope that my code will be clear and well-explained.
